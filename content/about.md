  description: "Hello, I am Dilyan Grigorov, or Dido for short, as everyone knows me. I have been dealing with SEO professionally for over 20 years, since the dawn of search engines, as well as programming, which is something I'm very passionate about. I love solving problems as a programmer as well as a webmaster. I'm always ready to learn new stuff and willing to adapt.  <br><br>

I am a Google Product Expert at the Google Search Central forums, as well as the Head of Content & Semantic department of Serpact, where I deal with content strategy, semantic analysis, natural language processing and technical SEO.<br><br>

I had the good fortune to be a part of 2 Google events, which is a great honor for me and I consider them very special moments in my life:<br>
 - Google Dance Zurich 2018, September<br>
 - Google Webmaster Unconference June 2021<br>
<br>
In 2022, I was also a speaker at BrightonSEO, where for the first time I dared to present a topic on which I presented Python scripts to help content marketers plan content for websites.

## A little backgroundâ€¦ ##

My first touch with IT was when I was 11 or back in 1999. My mother and I had a tradition of visiting local bookstores regularly. So one day, without knowing what I was doing, I got a book on C++.<br><br>

At first the language seemed complicated, but even as a child, I found that it was the fact that it was complicated that attracted me. I started solving problems, as well as looking for options to make CLI applications to solve various problems. I was happy with every task solved, the right answers and the fact that the applications helped in the implementation of certain work tasks on assignments by people and my teachers then.<br><br>

In 2003, SEO also found a place in my interests, although it was quite different then than it is now. However, I was wondering what practices to apply to help sites get better visibility on Google.<br><br>

This was also followed by entering different programming languages and different projects over the years - Python, Ruby, PHP, SQL, as well as the basis of the web - HTML, CSS, Javascript. The projects ranged from web-based to desktop-based, in the form of various challenges - from creating online stores and corporate websites, to participating in software applications for airline tickets and accounting. Until I left programming for a long time to devote more time to marketing.<br><br>

In a special and difficult moment of my life last year, I returned back to it. I have found that time can blur programming training and the specific practices that need to be applied, but the specific thinking of a programmer remains.  I went through a series of refresher courses in various online and mobile educational apps on C++, Python, Javascript, Go, Java. I found that I love creating of CLI applications and various functionalities for retrieving and processing information.<br><br>

I am also actively interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and one of my favorite topics - Natural Language Processing. I like Information Retrieval, Text understanding & classification, Pattern recognition, Recommendation systems, Ranking systems as well.<br><br>

I am currently refreshing my programming skills by enrolling in various software development academies, taking courses, and very soon, I intend to start contributing to open-source software projects.<br><br>
